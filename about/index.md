I am from a quite south Indian beach town called Visakhapatnam aka Vizag.

My parents work situation allowed me to visit and stay at various parts of the country and world.

In my early 20's, I spent some time living in [Bangalore](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bangalore-India) and then moved to the USA to study at [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) in New Jersey.

Currently, I reside in the [San Francisco Bay Area]() with my wife and kid.
